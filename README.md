Project Title: IP Address Detector Project Description: The IP Address Detector is a web application that combines the power of geolocation APIs and Google Maps to provide users with a comprehensive and interactive experience for exploring IP addresses. This project not only allows users to manually enter IP addresses but also offers the convenience of auto-detecting their own IP address. It leverages geolocation APIs to retrieve geographical information and seamlessly integrates Google Maps for visual representation.

Key Features:

Auto-Detect IP Address: The application automatically detects and displays the user’s own IP address without any manual input.

Manual IP Address Input: Users can manually enter any IP address they want to investigate into an input field.

Geolocation Information: The application retrieves and displays detailed information about the IP address, including:

Country City Timezone ISP (Internet Service Provider) Postal Code Continent Country Capital State/Province (if applicable) Interactive Google Maps: Geographical coordinates obtained from the geolocation API are used to display the location on an interactive Google Map, offering users a visual representation of the IP address’s physical location.

Technologies Used:

HTML/CSS JavaScript Geolocation APIs Google Maps API Regular Expressions: Used for input validation of IP addresses.

When a user accesses the application, it auto-detects and displays the user’s own IP address and associated geolocation information. Users can manually enter an IP address into the input field for which they want to retrieve geolocation information. Upon validation, the application sends an API request to the geolocation service with the provided IP address and the API key. The API returns geolocation data, which is then displayed on the webpage. Geographical coordinates are used to display the location on an interactive Google Map. Benefits:

Auto-detection of the user’s IP address provides a seamless experience. Users can explore the geographical context of any IP address. The integration of Google Maps offers an engaging visual representation.
